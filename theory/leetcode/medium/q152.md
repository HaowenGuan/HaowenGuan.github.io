# Medium Q152 <br> Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Constraints:
* $1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4$
* $-10 <= nums[i] <= 10$
* The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Notes
Edge cases:
* None

Mistake I made:
* Only comes out O(n^2) algorithm by myself

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_record = [nums[0]]
        min_record = [nums[0]]
        for i in nums[1:]:
            max_record.append(max(i, i * max_record[-1], i * min_record[-1]))
            min_record.append(min(i, i * max_record[-2], i * min_record[-1]))
        
        return max(max_record)
```

### Interpret
1. Dynamic programing
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)

Saving two lists, which records the best situation at each point, for example, the max subarray result and min subarray result until this point.
