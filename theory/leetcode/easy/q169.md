# Easy Q169 <br> Majority Element

https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

------------------------------
## Notes
Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

        return candidate
```

### Interpret
1. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(1)

The core of the algorithm is that The majority element always appear more than `[n / 2]` times.

Consider that every different element will collide and diminish, thus, the majority element that appear more than half of the total numbers will always survive at the end.
