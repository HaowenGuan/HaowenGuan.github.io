# Easy Q168 <br> Excel Sheet Column Title

https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/

## Notes
A bit tricky on how to deal with forward a digit, for example:

Z and A_ are essentially the same. It only goes forward when there is the need to place additional digits.
Therefore, we need to manually goes backward to fill the Z.

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        base = ord('A') - 1
        div = columnNumber
        result = ""
        while div > 0:
            div, mod = divmod(div, 26)
            if mod == 0:
                div -= 1
                mod += 26
            result = chr(base + mod) + result
        return result
```

### Interpret
1. Iteration analysis
2. Time complexity: O(log(n))
3. Space complexity: O(1)
