# Medium Q143 <br> Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln```

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

```L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

For example,
Given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}.

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range $[1, 5 * 10^4]$.
* $1 <= Node.val <= 1000$

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        # Calculate the mid point
        length = 0
        cur = head
        while cur is not None:
            cur = cur.next
            length += 1
        break_point = int(length / 2)
        
        # Locate left half list and right half list
        l_half = head
        r_half = head
        for i in range(break_point):
            r_half = r_half.next
        
        # Reverse the right half list
        prev = None
        pointer = r_half.next
        r_half.next = prev
        while pointer is not None:
            prev = r_half
            r_half = pointer
            pointer = pointer.next
            r_half.next = prev
        
        # Merge two lists
        pointer = l_half.next
        while pointer is not None:
            l_half.next = r_half
            l_half = pointer
            if r_half is not None:
                pointer = r_half.next
                r_half.next = l_half
                r_half = pointer
            pointer = l_half.next
        
        return head
```

### Interpret
1. Almost the best answer
2. First, iterate the linked list to find the length and mid-point
3. Second, locate two half list
4. Then, reverse the right half list
5. Finally, merge two list
6. Time complexity: O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/2) + O(n) = O(3n) $\equiv$ O(n)
7. Space complexity: O(1)

The first two steps can be simplified as a walker runner algorithm.

The reverse algorithm can be improved.

The Merge algorithm can also be improved.
