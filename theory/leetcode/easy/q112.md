# Easy Q112 <br> Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:
Given the below binary tree and $sum = 22$,

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
* $-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000$
* $-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000$

## Notes
Edge cases:
* If node node, even with target value 0, return False

Mistake I made:
* Didn't look carefully that negative value and negative target is valid.

## My Answer
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        if root is None:
            return False
        remain = targetSum - root.val
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return remain == 0
        else:
            return self.hasPathSum(root.left, remain) or
                   self.hasPathSum(root.right, remain)
```
