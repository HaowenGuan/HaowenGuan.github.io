# Medium Q450 <br> Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.



Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:
```
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7
```

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is $[5,4,6,2,null,null,7]$, shown in the following BST.
```

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7
```



Another valid answer is $[5,2,6,null,4,null,7]$.
```
    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```


Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[0, 10^4]$.
* $-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5$
* Each node has a unique value.
* root is a valid binary search tree.
* $-10^5 <= key <= 10^5$

## Notes
Edge cases:

* no node, return None
* one node and matched, return None
* one node not matched, return root

**Find predecessor**

Go left one time, and go right till end

**Find successor**

Go right one time, and go left till end

## My Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

        cur = root
        prev = None
        prev_dir = None
        while cur is not None and cur.val != key:

### Interpret
1. use while statement to find the target node
2. use `prev` to keep track of the previous node, in case the current node is a leaf to be deleted
3. Afterward, process different situations: not find, get predecessor, get successor, delete current.

class Solution:
    def successor(self, root):
        """
        One step right and then always left
        """
        root = root.right
        while root.left:
            root = root.left
        return root.val
    
    def predecessor(self, root):
        """
        One step left and then always right
        """
        root = root.left
        while root.right:
            root = root.right
        return root.val
        
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # delete from the right subtree
        if key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        # delete from the left subtree
        elif key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        # delete the current node
        else:
            # the node is a leaf
            if not (root.left or root.right):
                root = None
            # the node is not a leaf and has a right child
            elif root.right:
                root.val = self.successor(root)
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, root.val)
            # the node is not a leaf, has no right child, and has a left child    
            else:
                root.val = self.predecessor(root)
                root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, root.val)
                        
        return root
```
### Interpret
1. Recursively search for the target node, narrowing down the problem to the subtree with a root value of the target
2. If node is a leaf, just delete it, else, find the predecessor or successor value, replace by it and then delete it by calling the function again.
