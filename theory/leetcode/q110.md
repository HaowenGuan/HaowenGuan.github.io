# Easy Q110 <br> Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as: a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
* $-104 <= Node.val <= 104$

## Notes
Edge cases:
* If not node, return true


## My Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        deepth, balanced = self.helper(root, 1)
        return balanced
    
    def helper(self, node, deepth):
        if node is None:
            return deepth, True
        
        l_d, l_b = self.helper(node.left, deepth + 1)
        if not l_b:
            return 0, False
        r_d, r_b = self.helper(node.right, deepth + 1)
        if not r_b:
            return 0, False
        
        b = (abs(l_d - r_d) < 2)
        
        return max(l_d, r_d), b
```
### Interpret
1. The helper recursively goes downward, start from left, to check if every subtree is balanced.
2. The left most leaf node first reached bottom, and returns it depth upward to parent node.
3. Time complexity: in worst case, the tree is left skewed, the function helper will be called O(n) times.
4. Space complexity: the recursion function will be called O(n).
