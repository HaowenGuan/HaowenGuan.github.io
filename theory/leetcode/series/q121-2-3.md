# Easy Q121 <br> Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
```
max difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)

Example 2:
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
```
In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

Constraints
* $1 <= prices.length <= 10^5$
* $0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4$

## Notes
Edge cases:
* At least one price, so return 0 if only one day.

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy, start = prices[0], 1
        sell, end = prices[-1], len(prices) - 1
        
        while start <= end:
            if prices[start] < buy:
                buy = prices[start]
                start += 1
            elif prices[end] > sell:
                sell = prices[end]
                end -= 1
            elif prices[start] - sell > buy - prices[end]:
                end -= 1
            else:
                start += 1
                
        return sell - buy
```
### Interpret
1. Stupid solution, even though it is correct and O(n) time O(1) space, it is too complicated.

## Best Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = prices[i] - min_price
                
        return max_profit
```
### Interpret
1. Simple and elegant, O(n) time O(1) space.
2. One way traversal, find the max profit can make with the minimum and record it.
3. When seeing a new minimum, replace by it, but the historical max profit is recorded.

# Medium Q122 <br> Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
```
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
```
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

Example 3:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
```
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.


Constraints:
* $1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4$
* $0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4$

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        prev = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prev:
                profit += prices[i] - prev
            prev = prices[i]
        return profit

# Hard Q123 <br> Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
```
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
```
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are 
engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example 3:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
```
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


Constraints:
* $1 <= prices.length <= 10^5$
* $0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5$

                buy = prices[i]
            else:

                sell = prices[i]
            else:
                profit = max(sell - prices[i], profit)
            profit_list[i] += profit
        
        return max(profit_list)

1. Dynamic programing, just like the first question, record the best deal for each sub-division while traversing through the list start from beginning and end.
