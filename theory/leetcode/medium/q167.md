# Medium Q167 <br> Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

## Notes
First through: hash table

However, this is not the best solution

Two point shrinking can give the best result

The result is guaranteed, and the list is sorted

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        record = dict()
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] in record:
                return [record[numbers[i]] + 1, i + 1]
            record[target - numbers[i]] = i
        return None
```

### Interpret
1. Hash table searching
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)

## Best Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        start, end = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while True:
            cur = numbers[start] + numbers[end]
            if cur < target:
                start += 1
            elif cur > target:
                end  -= 1
            else:
                return [start + 1, end + 1]
```
### Interpret
1. Two pointer shrinking
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)

Since the answer is unique, the result is pre-determined.

Once we reach the smaller answer, all the number after the larger answer will result a sum that is greater than the target.

For this reason, the shrinking algorithm will work, and it will not skip the result.
