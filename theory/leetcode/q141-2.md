# Easy Q141 <br> Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

Constraints:
* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range $[0, 10^4]$.
* $-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5$
* pos is -1 or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Notes
Edge cases:
* No node, header is None, return False
* tail.next is None, return False
* Question: is node value unique?

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        records = set()
        while head is not None:
            if head in records:
                return True
            records.add(head)
            head = head.next
        return False
```

### Interpret
1. Record seen node in the set (hash table)
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity; O(n)

        if head is None:
            return False
        runner = head.next
        while head != runner:
            if runner is None or runner.next is None:
                return False
            head = head.next
            runner = runner.next.next
        return True
```
### Interpret
1. Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Racing Algorithm)
2. Imagine two runners - one fast one slow, They will eventually meet if there is a cycle.
3. Time complexity: O(n)
4. Sapce complexity: O(1)

# Medium Q142 <br> Linked List Cycle II

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to **(0-indexed)**. It is `-1` if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

Constraints:

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range $[0, 10^4]$.
* $-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5$
* `pos` is -1 or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

### Interpret
1. Walker and Runner algorithm
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity; O(1)

Walker go one block each time, Runner go 2 block each time. Runner start 1 block ahead of walker just for convenience.

If there is no cycle, the algorithm will end in the cycle finding algorithm. This case is simple.

Let's consider the cycle case. Assume it takes `X` steps to go into the cycle, and cycle has `Y` blocks (each named from `0 ~ (Y - 1)`). By the time the walker entering the cycle, the runner will stand at `(2X - X + 1) % Y = (X + 1) % Y`.

We know runner is two times faster than walker. The speed difference is 1. Runner will have to take `(Y - ((X + 1) % Y)) % Y` seconds to reach walker from behind. Therefore, walker and runner will both end up at block `(Y - ((X + 1) % Y)) % Y`, since walker start at block 0 when runner begin chasing.

After runner and walker meet, it comes to the second phase. 

How many steps it takes for the walker to step to the origin of cycle? Obviously, `(Y - ((Y - ((X + 1) % Y)) % Y)) % Y = (X + 1) % Y`.

How many steps it takes for the root to step to the origin of cycle? We knew it is X.

If we let walker step ahead one block, it will take `X % Y` steps to arrive origin, and after `X` steps, it will still stay at origin (think about it).

Therefore, we could command the walker and the root block to step forward at same pace, and they will eventually just meet at origin.

This is our answer, we could simplify my approach above as:

## Simplified Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None:
            return None
        walker = head
        runner = head
        
        # Check the existance of the cycle, record time
        while walker != runner:
            if runner is None or runner.next is None:
                return None
            walker = walker.next
            runner = runner.next.next
        
        # When the walker and root merge, it is the origin
        walker = walker.next
        while walker != head:
            walker = walker.next
            head = head.next
        return head
```
