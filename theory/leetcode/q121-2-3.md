# Easy Q121

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
```

max difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)

Example 2:
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
```

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

##### Constraints:
* $1 <= prices.length <= 10^5$
* $0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4$

### Notes:
Edge cases:
* At least one price, so return 0 if only one day.

Mistake I made:
* None

### My first Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy, start = prices[0], 1
        sell, end = prices[-1], len(prices) - 1
        
        while start <= end:
            if prices[start] < buy:
                buy = prices[start]
                start += 1
            elif prices[end] > sell:
                sell = prices[end]
                end -= 1
            elif prices[start] - sell > buy - prices[end]:
                end -= 1
            else:
                start += 1
                
        return sell - buy
```
### Comment
1. Stupid solution, even though it is correct and O(n) time O(1) space, it is too complicated.

### Best Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = prices[i] - min_price
                
        return max_profit
```
### Comment
1. Simple and elegant, O(n) time O(1) space.
2. One way traversal, find the max profit can make with the minimum and record it.
3. When seeing a new minimum, replace by it, but the historical max profit is recorded.

### My First Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        prev = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prev:
                profit += prices[i] - prev
            prev = prices[i]
        return profit

# Hard Q123

### My First Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit_list = []
        
        buy = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < buy:
                buy = prices[i]
            else:
                profit = max(prices[i] - buy, profit)
            profit_list.append(profit)
            
        sell = prices[-1]
        profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices) - 1, -1, -1):
            if prices[i] > sell:
                sell = prices[i]
            else:
                profit = max(sell - prices[i], profit)
            profit_list[i] += profit
        
        return max(profit_list)
```
### Comment:
1. Dynamic programing, just like the first question, record the best deal for each sub-division while traversing through the list start from beginning and end.
### One of the Best Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
	def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
		firstTransactionCost = prices[0]
		firstTransactionProfit = 0

		mostMoneyInPocket = -prices[0] 
		profitFromTwoTransactions = 0 

		for currentPrice in prices:
			firstTransactionCost = min(firstTransactionCost, currentPrice) 
			firstTransactionProfit = max(firstTransactionProfit, 
			                             currentPrice-firstTransactionCost)

			mostMoneyInPocket = max(mostMoneyInPocket, 
			                        firstTransactionProfit-currentPrice)
			profitFromTwoTransactions = max(profitFromTwoTransactions, 
			                                mostMoneyInPocket+currentPrice)
		return profitFromTwoTransactions
```
