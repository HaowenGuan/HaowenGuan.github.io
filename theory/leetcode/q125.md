# Easy Q125 <br> Valid Palindrome

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Constraints:
* $1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5$ 
* $s$ consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Notes:
Edge cases:
* None

Mistake I made:
* None

## My first Answer:
```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(s)-1
        while l < r:
            while l < r and not s[l].isalnum():
                l += 1
            while l <r and not s[r].isalnum():
                r -= 1
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            l +=1; r -= 1
        return True
```
