# Medium Q150 <br> Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

Constraints:
* $1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4$
* `tokens[i]` is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

## Notes
Edge cases:
* None

Mistake I made:
* Incorrect pop sequence
* Fail to deal with negative sign

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(tokens)):
            token = tokens[i]
            if len(token) > 1 or token.isnumeric():
                stack.append(int(token))
            else:
                y = stack.pop()
                x = stack.pop()
                if token == "+": 
                    stack.append(x + y)
                elif token == "-":
                    stack.append(x - y)
                elif token == "*":
                    stack.append(x * y)
                else:
                    stack.append(int(x / y))
        return stack.pop()
```

### Interpret
1. Simple
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)

```Python
def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        
    operations = {
        "+": lambda a, b: a + b,
        "-": lambda a, b: a - b,
        "/": lambda a, b: int(a / b),
        "*": lambda a, b: a * b
    }
    
    stack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token in operations:
            number_2 = stack.pop()
            number_1 = stack.pop()
            operation = operations[token]
            stack.append(operation(number_1, number_2))
        else:
            stack.append(int(token))
    return stack.pop()
```
### Interpret
1. Use Dictionary
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)
