# Easy Q157 <br> Read N Characters Given Read4

https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/

------------------------------
## Notes
Edge cases:
* What is the length of the input buf?
* Request is more than file
* File is more than Request

Mistake I made:
* Wasn't clear how buf works

## My Answer
```Python
"""
The read4 API is already defined for you.

    @param buf4, a list of characters
    @return an integer
    def read4(buf4):

# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
file = File("abcdefghijk") # File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
buf4 = [' '] * 4 # Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file
"""

class Solution:
    def read(self, buf, n):
        """
        :type buf: Destination buffer (List[str])
        :type n: Number of characters to read (int)
        :rtype: The number of actual characters read (int)
        """
        sub_n = 1
        length = 0
        while length < n and sub_n:
            buf4 = [""] * 4
            sub_n = read4(buf4)
            if length + sub_n > n:
                buf[length: n] = buf4[:n - length]
            else:
                buf[length: length + sub_n] = buf4[:sub_n]
            length += sub_n
        return min(length, n)
        
```

### Interpret
1. Simple algorithm
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)

https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/

------------------------------
## Notes
Edge cases:
* Called on empty input file
* Extra reading from previous query need to be saved
* Is buf guaranteed to have enough space for all input file?

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
# The read4 API is already defined for you.
# def read4(buf4: List[str]) -> int:

class Solution:
    def read(self, buf: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Clean the previous result, O(n)
        index = 0
        while buf[index] != " ":
            buf[index] = " "
            index += 1
        
        # Shift the the residue result to the front, O(1)
        length = 0
        while buf[index + 1] != " ":
            # Skip to add a break if residues are more than query amount
            if length != n:
                buf[length] = buf[index + 1]
                buf[index + 1] = " "
                index += 1
            length += 1
        
        # New queries from read4 function
        sub_n = 1
        while length < n and sub_n:
            buf4 = [" "] * 4
            sub_n = read4(buf4)
            if length + sub_n > n:
                buf[length: n] = buf4[:n - length]
                buf[n + 1: length + sub_n + 1] = buf4[n - length: sub_n]
            else:
                buf[length: length + sub_n] = buf4[:sub_n]
            length += sub_n
        
        return min(length, n)
```

### Interpret
1. Not very hard, except complicated. A bit tricky on saving results in buf
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)
Using an empty space to separate previous result and residue, since there is no way to pass information about how long is the previous query.
