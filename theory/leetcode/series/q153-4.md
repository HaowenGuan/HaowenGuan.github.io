# Medium Q153 <br> Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

------------------------------
## Notes
1. must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
2. At least one element in input, 

Mistake I made:
* None

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        head, tail = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while head != tail:
            mid = -(-(tail - head) // 2)
            if nums[tail - mid] < nums[tail]:
                tail -= mid
            else:
                head += mid
        return nums[head]
```

### Interpret
1. Simple Binary Search
2. Time complexity: O(log(n))
3. Space complexity: O(1)

# Hard Q154 <br> Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

------------------------------
## Notes
For the special case, such as one small number hide in the bush:
`[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1]`

Without iteration through to do the check, you can't do binary split since you never know which half of the list is the smallest hiding.


Mistake I made:
* Fail to deal with equation cases.

## My Answer
```Python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        head, tail = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while head != tail:
            mid = -(-(tail - head) // 2)
            if nums[tail - mid] <= nums[tail]:
                if nums[tail - mid] == nums[tail]:
                    for i in range(1, mid):
                        if nums[tail - mid + i] < nums[tail]:
                            return nums[tail - mid + i]
                tail -= mid
            else:
                head += mid
        return nums[head]
```

### Interpret
1. Similar to previous question.
2. Time complexity: O(n), Worst cases is O(n), however, it works as O(log(n)) when dealing with most cases.
3. Space complexity: O(1)
