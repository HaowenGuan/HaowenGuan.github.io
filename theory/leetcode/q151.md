# Medium Q151 <br> Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


Constraints:
* $1 <= s.length <= 10^4$
* s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
* There is at least one word in s.

```

### Interpret
1. Use build in functions.
2. Time complexity: O(n)
3. Space complexity: O(n)
